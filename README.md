## Usage

If you use the application through the deployed [Heroku site](https://fast-citadel-06627.herokuapp.com/), simply navigate to and interact with the site. Click on 'Get Started,' and from there, you have the ability to write and title your own notes. View previous notes (or delete them) by clicking on them on the left-hand side, or write new notes by clicking on the plus in the upper-right-hand corner and then typing and saving a new memo.

If the program was cloned and downloaded, get the application running by typing "node server.js" into the command-line. All features of the application are then accessible through *localhost* on your browser or other applications.

*View saved notes on the left, write new notes on the right, and save or start a new note by clicking the buttons in the upper-right-hand corner.*
